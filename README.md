### Build the C# Project
Open

    X:\vl-libs\VL.Devices.Nuitrack\src\VL.Devices.Nuitrack
    
in VisualStudio and build it. This is necessary for a few things that cannot yet be expressed in vl directly, like inheritance.

### Reference VL.Devices.Nuitrack.vl

In the VL document where you want to have access to the Kinect2 nodeset, add a dependency to:

	X:\vl-libs\VL.Devices.Nuitrack\VL.Devices.Nuitrack.vl

The available Nuitrack nodes should appear in the nodebrowser under Devices->Nuitrack.
